# Quick App showing basic use of HackerNews API

## To begin run `npm start`

## Features

- Hooks

- `Infinite Scroll` for hacker news item list. In reality it will stop after 500 elements. Creating a real infinite scroll would require changes to the HackerNews API. But our Infinite Scroll is a reasonable fascimile. In particular, it will save the browser from needing to render all 500 items at once. Instead, it will go in increments of 20.

- Simple unit tests with mocked API calls

- Use of various hooks

- Buttons to allow for switching between various kinds of stories
